					<h1 class="title"> ABOUT FERNS </h1>
					<p class="title-text">
						Ferns are one of the oldest groups of plants on <span class="span">Earth</span> , with a fossil record dating back to the middle Devonian

					<div class="cards">
						<p class="card-1">
							Today, ferns are the second-most diverse group of vascular plants on Earth, outnumbered only by flowering plants. With <span class="span-3"> around 10,500 living species </span>(PPG 1), ferns outnumber the remaining non-flowering vascular plants <span class="span-2">(the lycophytes and gymnosperms) </span> by a factor of 4 to 1. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-2">
							What follows is a short primer on the biology of ferns, making special note of some of the groups that went extinct along the way. There are separate sections that cover topics ranging from fern morphology and the fern lifecycle, along with the important role gametophytes play in the biology of ferns.

					<h2 class="sub-title">EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p class="text-1">
							The Devonian was a period of major change for the planet. The ancestors of green algae had migrated from their marine and freshwater environments onto land earlier in the <span class="span-3">Paleozoic era</span> and began to evolve stems and roots to enable their survival in the harsh conditions they faced in Earth’s prehistoric terrestrial environments. 
						</p>
						<p class="text-2">
							These first plants, however, lacked true leaves for millions of years, instead possessing chloroplasts in their stems to enable photosynthesis.
						</p>
						<p class="text-3">
							<span class="span"> In the middle and late Devonian, however, as plants began to spread throughout the world’s ecosystems, they locked up a significant amount of CO2 through burial and the weathering of bare rock, causing the planet to cool. </span>  
						</p>
						<p class="text-4">
							This meant that plants could evolve bigger structures to intercept more light without overheating, <span class="span-2">and it is during this time that the first leaves begin to appear. </span>
